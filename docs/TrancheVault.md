- MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual exchange.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: This calculation MAY NOT reflect the “per-user” price-per-share, and instead should reflect the

current on-chain conditions.

  call in the same transaction. I.e. deposit should return the same or more shares as previewDeposit if called
  in the same transaction.
- MUST NOT account for deposit limits like those returned from maxDeposit and should always act as though the
  deposit would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough tokens approved, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToShares and previewDeposit SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by depositing.

<br />

### deposit

```solidity

```

<br />

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their mint at the current block, given
current on-chain conditions.

- MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of assets that would be deposited in a mint call
  in the same transaction. I.e. mint should return the same or fewer assets as previewMint if called in the
  same transaction.

  would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough tokens approved, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToAssets and previewMint SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by minting.

<br />

### mint

```solidity
function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) external returns (uint256)
```

Mints exactly shares Vault shares to receiver by depositing amount of underlying tokens.

- MUST emit the Deposit event.
- MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the mint
  execution, and are accounted for during mint.
- MUST revert if all of shares cannot be minted (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not
  approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).

NOTE: most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vault’s underlying asset token.

given current on-chain conditions.

- MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be burned in a withdraw
  call in the same transaction. I.e. withdraw should return the same or fewer shares as previewWithdraw if
  called
  in the same transaction.
- MUST NOT account for withdrawal limits like those returned from maxWithdraw and should always act as though
  the withdrawal would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough shares, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToShares and previewWithdraw SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by depositing.

<br />

### withdraw

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256)
```

Burns shares from owner and sends exactly assets of underlying tokens to receiver.

- MUST emit the Withdraw event.
- MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the
  withdraw execution, and are accounted for during withdraw.
- MUST revert if all of assets cannot be withdrawn (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the owner
  not having enough shares, etc).

Note that some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Vault before a withdrawal may be performed.
Those methods should be performed separately.

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their redeemption at the current block,
given current on-chain conditions.

  in the same transaction. I.e. redeem should return the same or more assets as previewRedeem if called in the
  same transaction.
- MUST NOT account for redemption limits like those returned from maxRedeem and should always act as though the
  redemption would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough shares, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToAssets and previewRedeem SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by redeeming.

<br />

### redeem
